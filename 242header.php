      <p style="color:#6C1D20">At Orange Ave. we believe that life is better together. We need each other and together we are discovering just how much we can help each other. Yet it isn't all about us - it's really about our relationship with Jesus Christ. We believe He is still the best answer to living 'life' here on planet earth!</p>
