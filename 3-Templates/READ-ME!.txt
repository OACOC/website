Hey there friend :)

Thank you so much for downloading these 3 church graphic templates. I know you’re going to love them!

The first thing you need to do is download the fonts used in these graphics onto your computer. Every font used is free, and the download links are below:

- Klinic Slab Bold (http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=klinic)
- Nevis Bold (http://tenbytwenty.com/?xxxx_posts=nevis)
- Great Vibes Regular (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/great-vibes)
- Alex Brush (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alex-brush)
- Homestead (http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=homestead)
- Duke (http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=duke)
- Baron (http://fontfabric.com/baron-free-font/)
- Wisdom Script (http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=wisdom_script)

Several of these fonts are from Lost Type. They have a "name your price" feature where you can put in any dollar amount to download the font. You can put in $5, $10, or $0 and the font will begin downloading.

These templates are Photoshop files (.PSD) and thus, they are meant to be opened in Photoshop. But if you don't have Photoshop, that's perfectly okay! There's a program called GIMP that is essentially the free version of Photoshop. It looks like Photoshop and acts like Photoshop - exept it's free. It runs on both Mac and PC and you can download it here: http://www.gimp.org/downloads/

Though, you should know that in the last several years, Photoshop has changed their pricing structure. Instead of charging upwards of $1000 per version of Photoshop, you can now get full access to the latest version of Photoshop for only $10/month. That’s right! I  highly suggest you pick up a copy of Photoshop - here’s the link: http://www.photoshop.com

Feel free to change the color in these templates, and change the background image also! The templates can be changed and manipulated to create any number of different graphics. Enjoy!
